## Random Snippets

This is where I put pieces of code that I write that are too small for their own repo. Currently, there are:
 - Disease simulation models(sirmodel.py and arraymodel.py)
 - Travelling salesman Problem techniques(travelling_salesman.py)
 - Logical sentence evaluator(mathematical_logic.py)
